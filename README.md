## 🚀 How to Run

### Prerequisites
Before running LiteFlow, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher**
- **Apache Maven 3.6+**
- **Microsoft SQL Server** (2019 or later recommended)
- **Apache Tomcat 10+** (or compatible Jakarta EE server)
- **Redis Server** (optional, for caching)
- **Git** (for cloning the repository)

---

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/LiteFlow.git
cd LiteFlow-master
```

---

### Step 2: Set Up the Database

#### 2.1 Create Database
1. Open **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** or your preferred SQL client
2. Execute the schema creation script:
```sql
-- Run this file to create database structure
source database/liteflow_schema.sql
```

#### 2.2 Load Sample Data
```sql
-- Load initial data (users, roles, products, etc.)
source database/liteflow_data.sql

-- [Optional] Load procurement test data
source database/PROCUREMENT_SAMPLE_DATA.sql
```

#### 2.3 Update Database Connection
Edit the file: `src/main/resources/META-INF/persistence.xml`

```xml
<property name="jakarta.persistence.jdbc.url" 
          value="jdbc:sqlserver://localhost:1433;databaseName=LiteFlowDBO;encrypt=false"/>
<property name="jakarta.persistence.jdbc.user" value="YOUR_USERNAME"/>
<property name="jakarta.persistence.jdbc.password" value="YOUR_PASSWORD"/>
```

**Note:** Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_PASSWORD` with your SQL Server credentials.

---

### Step 3: Configure Redis (Optional)
If using Redis for caching:
1. Install and start Redis server on default port `6379`
2. No additional configuration needed (Jedis client auto-connects to localhost:6379)

---

### Step 4: Build the Project
```bash
# Clean and compile the project
mvn clean install

# Skip tests during build (optional)
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

**Expected output:**
```
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
[INFO] Total time: 45.123 s
```

The WAR file will be generated at: `target/LiteFlow.war`

---

### Step 5: Deploy to Tomcat

#### Option A: Manual Deployment
1. Copy `target/LiteFlow.war` to Tomcat's `webapps/` directory
2. Start Tomcat:
```bash
# Windows
catalina.bat start

# Linux/Mac
./catalina.sh start
```

#### Option B: Maven Tomcat Plugin (Development)
Add this to your `pom.xml` (if not already present):
```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.tomcat.maven</groupId>
    <artifactId>tomcat7-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>2.2</version>
    <configuration>
        <url>http://localhost:8080/manager/text</url>
        <server>TomcatServer</server>
        <path>/LiteFlow</path>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
```

Then deploy:
```bash
mvn tomcat7:deploy
```

---

### Step 6: Access the Application

Once Tomcat is running, open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:8080/LiteFlow
```

#### Default Login Credentials
After loading sample data, use these accounts to test different roles:

| Role | Email | Password |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Admin** | admin@liteflow.com | Admin123! |
| **Manager** | manager@liteflow.com | Manager123! |
| **Cashier** | cashier@liteflow.com | Cashier123! |
| **Kitchen** | kitchen@liteflow.com | Kitchen123! |

**⚠️ Security Warning:** Change default passwords immediately in production environments!

---

### Step 7: Run Tests (Optional)
```bash
# Run all unit tests
mvn test

# Generate code coverage report
mvn jacoco:report

# View coverage report
open target/site/jacoco/index.html
```

**Expected Coverage:**
- Line Coverage: ≥85%
- Branch Coverage: ≥80%
- Method Coverage: ≥90%

---

### Troubleshooting

#### Issue: Database Connection Failed
**Solution:** Verify SQL Server is running and credentials in `persistence.xml` are correct.

#### Issue: Port 8080 Already in Use
**Solution:** Change Tomcat port in `conf/server.xml` or kill the process using port 8080.

#### Issue: 404 Error After Deployment
**Solution:** Ensure WAR file is properly extracted in `webapps/LiteFlow/` directory.

#### Issue: JWT Token Errors
**Solution:** Check that JWT secret key is properly configured in environment variables or config files.
